                  <p>Our inspiration came from our founders: brothers Braxton and Clay who enjoyed seltzers but wanted more. They appreciated the low-calorie, non-filling qualities of seltzers but wanted to improve the overall taste. They desired a cleaner, more creative, refreshing taste and finish than was available in most seltzer drinks on the market. They did extensive testing and research, and they found that a combination of carefully crafted, all-natural flavors combined with premium spirits and pure seltzer water created the optimal, crisp drink.
                    Having both grown up and attended college in Kentucky, Braxton and Clay knew they wanted to start this business close to home. Louisville – specifically, the vibrant NuLu Marketplace – was the perfect location. They brought their new drinks to the Derby City and are continuing to push the possibilities for seltzer and define the “seltzery” experience. They applied painstaking detail to every aspect of their drinks and their space. They are thrilled to share their passion with you and hope that The Local Seltzery becomes your go-to spot in Louisville!

                    <h2 class="about-headers"> <img src="./images/icon.iconset/icon_32x32.png" alt="">Our Product</h2>
                    <p> Our priority is to make and serve the best seltzer drinks available in the coolest venue. It is fair to say The Local Seltzery is obsessed with providing the cleanest, most creative and refreshing beverages on the market. We continuously roll out new products, try to keep with what is in season, and stay ahead of the rest of the beverage industry. </p>
                   
                    <h3>Our ingredients</h3>
                    <p>Good drinks do not have to be loaded with sugar and other additives. By using all-natural, clean ingredients, we serve flavorful, refreshing drinks with a fraction of the carbs and calories of traditional cocktails and beers. Further, all our drinks are vegan and gluten-free, without sacrificing taste. 
                        Also, going to a bar does not have to revolve around alcohol. While we proudly serve alcoholic drinks, we also offer non-alcoholic versions of most of our seltzers. Enjoy our refreshing seltzers in the company of friends without having to settle for the limited, boring, standard alcohol-free options. 
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="about-headers"> <img src="./images/icon.iconset/icon_32x32.png" alt="">Our Purpose</h2>
                    <h3>To define the premium “seltzery” experience. </h3>
                    <p>At the time of our opening, there were only a small handful of “seltzeries” in the United States. Seltzer products were growing in popularity and familiarity, but a dedicated space to enjoy craft seltzers – seltzeries – was a new concept. We set out to define this experience, creating a space that was just as unique as our products. We’re confident we have achieved this. 
                        We also took a distinctive approach with our products. Through implementing a novel, computer-controlled seltzer gun delivery system, we can accurately and efficiently serve each customer their made-to-order, delicious beverage. This technology enables us to serve our customers more quickly and consistently than most other bars. Again, we’re consistently striving for a more premium experience for our customers. 
                        </p>

                        </h2>
                        <h3>To serve our local community premium seltzer products in a vibrant space with exceptional service. </h3>
                        <p>At The Local Seltzery, we know the customer experience is as much about the product as it is about the environment and the service, and we do not shy away from dwelling on the details pertaining to each. We are honored to serve a product our customers can feel good about drinking, in a venue our community can be proud of. Maintaining this standard is our highest priority, and we will endlessly pursue this mission.
